## Chapter 04: The Learning Phase

### 4 Learning to learn
There are two types of progress (check the graphs.)
* Plateau s, slow and steady.
* Peacks, wuick learn.

When you discover something new in a game, ther will be a drop. You are trying a new thing, then there will be a peak when you master this new dicovery. Then you go steady up until you discover a new thing that changes the way you think.

Our truest, richest learning comes from jumping into ravines, not by staying safely on a plateau.
Ravines are everywhere in our lives, and they are the things that people usually refer to when they
say, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.”
