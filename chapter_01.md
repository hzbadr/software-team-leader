## Chapter 01: Striving toward a Team Leader Manifesto

>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the word to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.  
George Bernard Shaw.

###  1- Striving toward a team leader manifesto
Not easy thing to accomplish or measure
A story how the writer failed in his job because the lack of communcation between the team and the team leader.

Things that could have been done to prevent that Greek tragedy:
  * Say "I don't know" ASAP.
  * Daily stand-ups.
  * A rule that no one is allowed to work on something in his own for more than one day.
  * Team leader could have done a one-on-one meeting weekly do discover what was up.

#### 1-1 Why shoud you care?

  Most team leaders suffer from the same basic bad experience. Most weren't taught how to do this type of work. May be what we are missing is some good old-fashioned people skills.

#### 1-2 Don't be afraid to become management

  A lot of developer seem to be agains going into management. They might be afraid of alot of meetings, no time to code, lose friendship ...

You can make time for the things you care about. A good team leader challenges the team and the people to solve their own problems. As people learn how to solve their own peoblem, 
* team leader will have more free time.
* An opportunity to learn new things everyday.
* Experiment with human beings.

Be more than one thing. You are not just a developer, you are also a team leader. How many time you said to yourself "I wish I could change X".

Challenge your self and your team:

1. Do one thing every day that scares you.
2. Get rejected at least once a day.

These are powerful idea to make sure you are actually learning something.

The goal and the way we measure our work is "the overall growth in skills of self-organaization and salf-maintenace in each member of our team and the team as a whole".

1. We accepts that teams needs change continuously based on their skills, so we embrace a continuously changing leadership style over one-style-fits-all leadership approach.
2. We believe in challenging ourselved and our teams
  * We create slack of time to learn an be challenged.
  * We embrace taking risks over staying safe.
  * we embrace fear and discomfort while learning over keeping people within their comfort zone,
  * We embrace experimentation as a constant practice over maintaining the status quo (people, tools, processes, environment)
3. We believe our core practice is leading people not wielding machine so:
  * We embrace spending more time with our team than in meetings.
  * We embrace treating software problems as people problems.
  * we learn people skills and communication techniques.
