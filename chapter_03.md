## Chapter 03: The Servival Phase

### Survival Mode
  Where most teams are located. "Not having enough time to learn"

#### 3-1 Are you in survival mode?
If your team is chasing its own tail and putting out fires instead of sitting down and experiment, learn new things.

* The compfortable zone
 
  It's quite easy to stay in the survival mode, actually alot of people feel right at home with this zone, they know how to operate and what other expects of them, and they knew how to succeed in the crule world.
  It's warm and fuzzy, even more problematic it perpetuates it self. When we are in survival mode, we tend to stay there. Sort of addiction cycle.

* The survival mode addiction

  We convince ourselves that the current course of action is the only one that can make us feel better.
  For example, a dilemma fix a fire or refactor the code so fire won't flare up again, what we do?
  We convince ourselves that putting a fire now will let us rest a bil in the near future. The next time that dilemma occures we remember that the last time we made a choice the made us feel better immediately, so we turn to that choice again.
  
* This cycle can be broken by:
  * Realizing we are in such a cycle.
  * Finding the courage to break the cycle.

#### 3-2 Getting out of survival mode
To get out of survival mode, you have to worry about one thing only, cerating slack time as a standard in your work process.

This means, you will have to remove some commitments (that's a risk that many team leaders are afraid to take).

> If done well, management is a tough job, which is why the pay is premium "Same3 ya 7oda?". However, there will always be those managers who want to get paid for the hard parts of management work without actually doning them.
Jerry Weinberg’s book Managing teams Congruently

By creating slack time, you are not in the survival phase, you are in the learning phase.

##### How much slach time do you need?
Learning time is up to 10 time slower than normal productive time.
If you are learning TDD, developers will be 10 times slower imlementing the same features.

If you can't accommodate for such learning, perhapse you are in the survival mode.

#### 3-3 Making slack time-required actions.
How do you drag your team out of survival mode? you can start by understanding the mess you are currently in.

##### Find out you cirrent commitments
A board with three simple columns
* A todo column
* An in-progress column
* A done column

Ask each team member what they are working on, add it to the board

##### Find out your current risks
Future Memory:
  Ask your team "Imagine it's six month from now, and the project has failed. Why did it fail?"
  
Be prepared to heare some things that might surprise you. If you didn't hear anything, it's a good time for one-to-ones private meeting.

Make a list with risks uncovered.

##### Plan a red line
You commit to make time for your team to learn.

##### How do you remove commitments?
By letting whoever needs to know, know. Boss, Stackholders ...
* Show them a list of current tasks in progress
* Exmplain that many of these tasks could be avoided if the team have enough time to learn.
* Explain yout outlook for the next few months.
* Explain gain from this move.

#### 3-4 Why slack?
##### Remember why you are doing this
##### The risk of loosing face in upper management.
##### The risk of failing
##### This is what you are being paid for.
You are being paid to keep taking the team to the next level of performance and professionalism
##### Realize that you are going to break your own pattern.
A story of the pinball game score.
##### Do not fear confrontation.
You have to be able to say, "This is the best way I know how to run this team. Let me do my job." You should be able to say, "This is how I work. If you know someone who can do this job better and get this team to be better, you should hire them."

If you accept survival mode for the way it is, it's your fault just as much as it is everyone else's fault.

##### Don't despair in the face of nitpickers


#### 3-5 Command and Control
When the ship is sinking, the captain doesn’t call a meeting. The captain gives orders.

One of the common ways to recognize such lack of skill to self-organize is that the team keeps expecting the team leader to solve all of their problems for them.

##### Correct bad decisions
No time to debate.
##### Play to the team's strength
Let every team member do what he they do best, not to challenge them.
##### Get rid of disturbances.
Bad influencers, have a one-on-one meeting with them, move hime to a separate room.

#### 3-6 During the transformation you will likely need to ..
##### Spend more time with the team.
50% at least, move you desk to the team's room, you will be able to know when someone is stucked.
##### Take ownership of your team.
All tasks must go thorugh you.
##### Learn how to say no by saying yes
If your stackholders want a feature X, say OK but which feature on the list should be pushed down?
##### Start a daily stand-up meetings.
##### Understand the notion of broken windows.
If people see an opening to do something, they will take advantage of it to eventually do whatever they want.
Code reviewer, turns out they are a hotbed for broken windows.
##### Do serious code reviews
No piece of code gets checked in to source control without a code review.
If you decide that “some code” doesn’t need to get reviewed, that’s a broken window.
