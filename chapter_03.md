## Chapter 03: The Servival Phase

### Survival Mode
  Where most teams are located. "Not having enough time to learn"

#### 3-1 Are you in survival mode?
If your team is chasing its own tail and putting out fires instead of sitting down and experiment, learn new things.

* The compfortable zone
 
  It's quite easy to stay in the survival mode, actually alot of people feel right at home with this zone, they know how to operate and what other expects of them, and they knew how to succeed in the crule world.
  It's warm and fuzzy, even more problematic it perpetuates it self. When we are in survival mode, we tend to stay there. Sort of addiction cycle.

* The survival mode addiction

  We convince ourselves that the current course of action is the only one that can make us feel better.
  For example, a dilemma fix a fire or refactor the code so fire won't flare up again, what we do?
  We convince ourselves that putting a fire now will let us rest a bil in the near future. The next time that dilemma occures we remember that the last time we made a choice the made us feel better immediately, so we turn to that choice again.
  
* This cycle can be broken by:
  * Realizing we are in such a cycle.
  * Finding the courage to break the cycle.
