## Chapter 03: The Servival Phase

### Survival Mode
  Where most teams are located. "Not having enough time to learn"

#### 3-1 Are you in survival mode?
If your team is chasing its own tail and putting out fires instead of sitting down and experiment, learn new things.

* The compfortable zone
 
  It's quite easy to stay in the survival mode, actually alot of people feel right at home with this zone, they know how to operate and what other expects of them, and they knew how to succeed in the crule world.
  It's warm and fuzzy, even more problematic it perpetuates it self. When we are in survival mode, we tend to stay there. Sort of addiction cycle.

* The survival mode addiction

  We convince ourselves that the current course of action is the only one that can make us feel better.
  For example, a dilemma fix a fire or refactor the code so fire won't flare up again, what we do?
  We convince ourselves that putting a fire now will let us rest a bil in the near future. The next time that dilemma occures we remember that the last time we made a choice the made us feel better immediately, so we turn to that choice again.
  
* This cycle can be broken by:
  * Realizing we are in such a cycle.
  * Finding the courage to break the cycle.

#### 3-2 Getting out of survival mode
To get out of survival mode, you have to worry about one thing only, cerating slack time as a standard in your work process.

This means, you will have to remove some commitments (that's a risk that many team leaders are afraid to take).

> If done well, management is a tough job, which is why the pay is premium "Same3 ya 7oda?". However, there will always be those managers who want to get paid for the hard parts of management work without actually doning them.
Jerry Weinbergâ€™s book Managing teams Congruently

By creating slack time, you are not in the survival phase, you are in the learning phase.

##### How much slach time do you need?
Learning time is up to 10 time slower than normal productive time.
If you are learning TDD, developers will be 10 times slower imlementing the same features.

If you can't accommodate for such learning, perhapse you are in the survival mode.

#### 3-3 Making slack time-required actions.
How do you drag your team out of survival mode? you can start by understanding the mess you are currently in.
