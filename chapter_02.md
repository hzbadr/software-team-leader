### 2- Elastic Leadership

#### 2-1 The role of the team leader
      The wrong definition "The team leader should provide to the team everything they need and get out of their way!"
    
##### 2-2 Growth through challenge
The ROLE is => "A team leader grows the people on their team"
what about delivering a value to the company? The writer believes that delivering a value flows naturally from that definition.
Loyalty grows

Challenge
  To grow people means they acquire new skills, for that yuo must challenge them. Stop solving their problems.
You'r a bottleneck
  By solving their problems you become a bottleneck, they will not be able to manage without you.
    
##### 2-3 Crunch time and leadership styles
Somethimes it doesn't make sense to challenege people "the release is late!"
Leadership Styles:
  * Challenging People
  * Command And Control
  * Facilitating
Sometimes command and control style os required, where a leader make a clear cut decisions 
"We are using source control, and no meeting to discuss we should use it or not!"
Use it to direct the team down a path when team is not able to face reality with no time to learn.
Facilitating can be desciped "Lock the team in the room, give them a goal, and get out of their way"

#### 2-4 Which style to use?
let's start with the opposite quistion, when not to use each of these syles?

  1. Command And Control
    * You make the decisions and tell the team what to do. There's little room for people to learn.
    This approach will not work if your team already knows what to do.
  
  2. Coach
    * Known as "The Teacher" the opposite of the controlling leader, let the team take decision to learn.
    Time is not issue for him.
    This approach will not work if you and your team have no free time to learn.
  
  3. Facilitator
    * Stays out of everyone's way, makes sure that the current environment, conditions, goals and constraints will drive the team
    to get things done.
    This approach will not work if the team doesn't have sufficient skills to solve their own problems.

##### 2-5 Leadership styles and team phases
      Each style belongs to different team phase

##### 2-6 The three team phases
      The question "Which leadership style is right?" should be asked in a daily basis, because team can flow in and out of these phases based on many factors.

      * Survival phase
        No time to learn. To accomplish your goal "getting people grow" you need to make time for them to learn. To get them out of the survival mode and create a slack time  most likely you will need command and control style.

      * Learning phase
        You can tell you are in this phase of your team has enough time to learn and experiment.
        Slack time can be used for learning, removing technical debt or both.
        "with people who have no experience with it", your goal is to grow the team to self-organization by teaching and challenging them.
        To achieve that you will need to become more of a coaching style with the occasional intervention of the controlling.

      * Self-organization phase
        If you leave the work for afew days without being afraid to turn off you cell phone.
        Your goal is to keep things as they are by bein facilitator and keeping an eye on the team's ability to handle current reality. 
        You will have time to experiment. 5% of the software teams.

##### 2-7 When does the team move between phases?
      Keep an eye on the team's assets, to recognize when you team needs a new type of leadership
      Assets #1 Team's knowledge and skills
      Assets #2 Team's amount of slack time
